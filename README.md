# Chromatic spatial contrast
This repository contains supplementary information and Matlab code accompanying the manuscript by De and Horwitz, "Coding of chromatic spatial contrast by macaque V1 neurons". Please read the LICENSE before using the contents of this repository.

## The repository contains 4 major folders:
- **Datasets**: Datasets for analysis and generating figures relevant to De and Horwitz, 2021.
- **Scripts for analysis**: Scripts for the analysis of spatial signal integration between 2 subregions of a RF in response to whitenoise stimuli and isoresponse puctate flashes. This folder also contains script for the analysis of phosphor signal integration within individual subregions. 
- **Scripts for paper figures**: Scripts for generating main figures and responses to reviewers' comments.
- **utils**: Utils for white noise analysis and model fitting
