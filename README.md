# Chromatic spatial contrast
This repository contains supplementary information and Matlab code accompanying the manuscript by De and Horwitz, "Coding of chromatic spatial contrast by macaque V1 neurons". Please read the [license] (https://github.com/horwitzlab/Chromatic_spatial_contrast/blob/b70edc892c0184126acab1fe7586e8302df23428/LICENSE) before using contents of this repository.

## The repository contains 4 major folders:
- Datasets: Datasets for analysis and generating figures relevant to De and Horwitz, 2021.
- Scripts for analysis: Scripts for the analysis of spatial signal integration between 2 subregions of a RF in response to whitenoise stimuli and isoresponse puctate flashes. This folder also contains script for the analysis of phosphor signal integration within individual subregions. 
- Scripts for paper figures: Scripts for generating main figures and responses to reviewers' comments.
- utils: Utils for white noise analysis and model fitting
