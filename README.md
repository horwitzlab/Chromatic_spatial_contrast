# Chromatic spatial contrast
This repository contains supplementary information and Matlab code accompanying the manuscript by De and Horwitz, "[Coding of chromatic spatial contrast by macaque V1 neurons](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=LMLBAI8AAAAJ&alert_preview_top_rm=2&citation_for_view=LMLBAI8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC)". Please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) before using the contents of this repository.

## The repository contains 4 major folders:
- **[Datasets](datasets/)**: Datasets for analysis and generating figures relevant to De and Horwitz, 2021.
- **[Scripts for analysis](scripts_for_analysis)**: Scripts for the analysis of spatial signal integration between 2 subregions of a RF in response to whitenoise stimuli and isoresponse puctate flashes. This folder also contains script for the analysis of phosphor signal integration within individual subregions. 
- **[Scripts for paper figures](scripts_for_paper_figures/)**: Scripts for generating main figures and responses to reviewers' comments.
- **[utils](utils/)**: Utils for white noise analysis and model fitting
